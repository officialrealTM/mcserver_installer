## <u>About the project</u>

With this project, my goal was to make installing Minecraft servers, no matter if they are Vanilla, Forge, Spigot, Paper and Leaf, as easy and beginner-friendly as possible. 
After making some Tutorials on my [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/realtm_csgo) and providing a detailed [Documentation](https://docs.realtm.de) for them, there were still questions and problems on how to install a Minecraft Server on a Linux-Server.
Thats why I created this All-in-One solution for installing a Minecraft Server (Forge, Vanilla, Spigot & Paper).

## FAQ

#### **Can I use this Script on other Distros?**

No. At least not yet. The Script has been developed and tested on --> [Supported Distros](https://github.com/officialrealTM/mcserver_installer#supported-distros).
To disable the Distro check see: [Experimental Settings](https://github.com/officialrealTM/mcserver_installer#experimental-settings)
#### **Where are my Serverfiles located?**

You Minecraft Server files will get stored in `/Servers/Minecraft-<versionnumber>`  

When installing multiple servers of the same type (e.g. two Minecraft 1.8.9 Servers) the second folder will be called `Minecraft-<versionnumber>-1` (or 2 and so on)  

#### **Can I run more than one server at once?**

Yes. But here you need to keep a few things in mind:
- Your Linux server need to be powerfull enough
- You need to adjust the Port of the second/third/etc. Minecraft server (because Port 25565 is already in use.) This can be adjusted in the `server.properties` file  

#### **Can I change the amount of RAM allocated to my Minecraft Server after the installation?**

Yes. To do so go to your Server folder (`cd /Servers/Minecraft-<versionnumber>`) and open the `start.sh`file.  
In the last line of this file you can adjust the number after `-Xmx` to adjust more or less ram.

#### **Can I use this script to install Snapshot Versions of Minecraft?**

**No.** This script can only install full game versions. Snapshot Versions are not supported!

#### **I've accidentally closed my Minecraft console. How can I open it again?** 
Dont worry, the console will kept open in the background using *screen*.  
Use this command, to show all active screen sessions:`screen -ls`  

If only one Sessions is active you can use this command, to open it: `screen -rx`
If multiple Sessions are active use this command: `screen -rx <Name of screen session>`

#### **How to close (detach)  my console?**
To close (detach) you Minecraft Console press **[CTRL]**+**[A]** and than **[CTRL]**+**[D]**
